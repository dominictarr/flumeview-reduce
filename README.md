# flumeview-reduce

A flumeview into a reduce function.
Stream append-only log data into a reduce function to calculate a state.

## Example

``` js
var FlumeLog = require('flumelog-offset')
var codec = require('flumecodec')
var Flume = require('flumedb')
var Reduce = require('flumeview-reduce')

//statistics exports a reduce function that calculates
//mean, stdev, etc!
var statistics = require('statistics')

//initialize a flumelog with a codec.
//this example uses flumelog-offset, but any flumelog is valid.
var log = FlumeLog(file, 1024*16, codec.json) //use any flume log

//attach the reduce function.
var db = Flume(log).use('stats',
  Reduce(1, statistics, function map (data) {
    return data.value
  }
)

db.append({value: 1}, function (err) {

  db.stats.get(function (err, stats) {
    console.log(stats) // => {mean: 1, stdev: 0, count: 1, sum: 1, ...}
  })
})
```

## FlumeViewReduce(version, reduce, map?) => FlumeView

construct a flumeview from this reduce function. `version` should be a number,
and must be provided. If you make a breaking change to either `reduce` or `map`
then increment `version` and the view will be rebuilt.

`map` is optional. If map is applied, then each item in the log is passed to `map`
and then if the returned value is not null, it is passed to reduce.

``` js
var _value = map(value)
if(_value != null)
  state = reduce(state, _value, seq)
```

using a `map` function is useful, because it enables efficiently streaming the realtime
changes in the state to a remote client.

then, pass the flumeview to `db.use(name, flumeview)`
and you'll have access to the flumeview methods on `db[name]...`

## db[name].get(cb)

get the current state of the reduce. This will wait until the view is up to date, if necessary.

## db[name].stream({live: boolean}) => PullSource

Stream the changing reduce state. for this to work, a map function must be provided.

If so, the same reduce function can be used to process the output.

## db[name].value => Observeable

An [observeable](https://github.com/dominictarr/obv) of the reduced state. Subscribe a listener to changes like so:

```js
db[name].value(newView => {
  console.log('new view just arrived!', newView)
})
```

## Stores

`flumeview-reduce` currently includes several _store_ implementations,
this is how the actual data is persisted. the current implementations are

* 'flumeview-reduce/store/fs' - store in a file.
* 'flumeview-reduce/store/local-storage' - `localStorage`, in a browser
* 'flumeview-reduce/store/remote' - a meta store that keeps a local copy of a remote view.

to set a store, you must set up flumeview-reduce via the lower level dependency injection api.

``` js
var createReduce = require('flumeview-reduce/inject')

var Reduce = createReduce(Store)

//then use Reduce normally

var view = db.use('view', Reduce(version, reduce, map)) //etc

//since remote is most interesting

var Remote = require('flumeview-reduce/store/remote')
function get (opts, cb) {
  //call the get method on the remote copy of the flumeview
  view.get(opts, cb)
}
var RemoteReduce = createReduce(Remote(get, Store, codec))

var remoteView = _db.use('view', Reduce(version, reduce, map)) //etc
//make sure you pass the exact same reduce and map functions to the remote view!
```
